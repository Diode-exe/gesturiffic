## Control your computer with your hand and a webcam

### Usage

The cursor position is calculated based off where your index finger is in the camera frame.
Change ```x_scale = 2.0``` and ```y_scale = 2.0``` based on how easy it is to reach the edge of the computer screen.
Upping the scale will make it easier to reach the edge, but will make it less precise and faster. Lowering it will do the opposite.

Tap your index and thumb together to left click, double tap to double click, tap thumb and pinky for right click. 
You have to tap pretty hard together.

### Requirements
```pip install -r .\requirements.txt```
